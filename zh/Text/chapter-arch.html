  <h2 id="heading_id_3" class="en">Introduction</h2>

  <h2 id="heading_id_3" class="zh">前言</h2>

  <p class="en">You can't build a system without some idea of what you want to build. And you can't build it if you don't know the environment in which it will work. GUI programs are different to batch processing programs; games programs are different to business programs; and distributed programs are different to standalone programs. They each have their approaches, their common patterns, the problems that typically arise and the solutions that are often used.</p>

  <p class="zh">你若不知道你想构建什么，就无法构建一个系统。而如果你不知道它会在何种环境下工作，也同样不行。就像GUI程序不同于批处理程序，游戏程序不同于商业程序一样，分布式程序也不同于独立的程序。它们都有各自的方法，常见的模式，经常出现的问题以及常用的解决方案。</p>

  <p class="en">This chapter covers the highl evel architectural aspects of distributed systems. There are many ways of looking at such systems, and many of these are dealt with.</p>

  <p class="zh">本章涵盖了分布式系统的上层架构，从多种角度考虑了这样的系统及其依赖。</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_4" class="en">Protocol Layers</h2>

  <h2 id="heading_id_4" class="zh">协议层</h2>

  <p class="en">Distributed systems are <em>hard</em>. There are multiple computers involved, which have to be connected in some way. Programs have to be written to run on each computer in the system and they all have to co-operate to get a distributed task done.</p>

  <p class="zh">分布式系统很<em>复杂</em>，它涉及到多台计算机的连接方式。我们编写的程序必须能在该系统中的每一台计算机上运行，它们必须都能协同操作来完成一项分布式任务。</p>

  <p class="en">The common way to deal with complexity is to break it down into smaller and simpler parts. These parts have their own structure, but they also have defined means of communicating with other related parts. In distributed systems, the parts are called <em>protocol layers</em> and they have clearly defined functions. They form a stack, with each layer communicating with the layer above and the layer below. The communication between layers is defined by protocols.</p>

  <p class="zh">解决这种复杂性的一般方法，就是将它分解为更小更简单的部分。这些部分都有它们自己的结构，但也定义了与其它相关部分进行通信的方式。在分布式系统中，这种部分称为<em>协议层</em>，它们的功能都有明确的定义。它们在一起形成层次结构，并与其各自的上下层进行通行。层次之间的通信则由协议来定义。</p>

  <p class="en">Network communications requires protocols to cover high-level application communication all the way down to wire communication and the complexity handled by encapsulation in protocol layers.</p>

  <p class="zh">网络通信所需的协议覆盖了从上层应用通信一直到底层有线通信的所有方式，它们的复杂性通过在协议层中进行封装来处理。</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_5" class="en">ISO OSI Protocol</h3>

  <h3 id="heading_id_5" class="zh">ISO OSI协议</h3>

  <p class="en">Although it was never properly implemented, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) protocol has been a major influence in ways of talking about and influencing distributed systems design. It is commonly given in the following figure:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/iso.gif" /></p>

  <p class="zh">尽管OSI（开放系统互联）协议从未被完整地实现过，但它仍对分布式系统的讨论和设计产生了十分重要的影响。它的结构大致为下图所示：<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/zh/iso.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_6" class="en">OSI layers</h3>

  <h3 id="heading_id_6" class="cn">OSI层</h3>

  <p class="en">The function of each layer is:</p>

  <p class="cn">每一层的功能为：</p>

  <ul class="en">
    <li>Network layer provides switching and routing technologies</li>

    <li>Transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control</li>

    <li>Session layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications.</li>

    <li>Presentation layer provides independance from differences in data representation (e.g. encryption)</li>

    <li>Application layer supports application and end-user processes</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="zh">
    <li>网络层提供交换和路由技术</li>

    <li>传输层在终端系统间提供透明的数据传输，并负责端对端的错误恢复及流程控制</li>

    <li>会话层在应用间建立、管理并结束连接</li>

    <li>表现层提供数据表现差异的独立性（例如加密）</li>

    <li>应用层支持应用与最终用户的处理</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="heading_id_7" class="en">TCP/IP Protocol</h3>

  <h3 id="heading_id_7" class="zh">TCP/IP协议</h3>

  <p class="en">While the OSI model was being argued, debated, partly implemented and fought over, the DARPA internet research project was busy building the TCP/IP protocols. These have been immensely succesful and have led to The Internet (with capitals). This is a much simpler stack:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/tcp_stack.gif" /></p>

  <p class="zh">当OSI标准模型正在为实现细节闹得不可开交时，DARPA互联网技术项目却在忙着构建TCP/IP协议。它们取得了极大的成功，并引领了Internet（首字母大写），因为这是个更简单的层次结构：<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/zh/tcp_stack.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_8" class="en">Some Alternative Protocols</h3>

  <h3 id="heading_id_8" class="zh">一些可选的协议</h3>

  <p class="en">Although it almost seems like it, the TCP/IP protocols are not the only ones in existence and in the long run may not even be the most successful. There are many protocols occupying significant niches, such as</p>

  <p class="zh">尽管现在到处都是TCP/IP协议，但它并不是唯一存在的。从长远来看，它甚至不会是最成功的。还有些协议占有重要的地位，比如：</p>

  <ul class="en">
    <li>Firewire</li>

    <li>USB</li>

    <li>Bluetooth</li>

    <li>WiFi</li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="zh">
    <li>火线</li>

    <li>USB</li>

    <li>蓝牙</li>

    <li>WiFi</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="en">Thre is active work continuing on many other protocols, even quite bizarre ones such as those for the "internet in space."</p>

  <p class="zh">还有些其它的协议在继续活跃地工作，甚至还有些像“太空互联网”这样奇怪的协议。</p>

  <p class="en">The focus in this book will be on the TCP/IP, but you should be aware of these other ones.</p>

  <p class="zh">本书将重点介绍TCP/IP，但你也应当了解一些其它的协议。</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_9" class="en">Networking</h2>

  <h2 id="heading_id_9" class="zh">网络</h2>

  <p class="en">A network is a communications system for connecting end systems called hosts. The mechanisms of connection might be copper wire, ethernet, fibre optic or wireless, but that won't concern us here. A local area network (LAN) connects computers that are close together, typically belonging to a home, small organisation or part of a larger organisation.</p>

  <p class="zh">网络是一个通信系统，它连接了称为主机的最终系统。这种连接机制可以是铜线、以太网、光纤或无线，但这些与我们无关。局域网（LAN）将计算机紧密地连接在一起，一般为家庭、小型组织或大型组织的一部分。</p>

  <p class="en">A Wide Area Network (WAN) connects computers across a larger physical area, such as between cities. There are other types as well, such as MANs (Metropolitan Area Network), PANs (Personal Are Networks) and even BANs (Body Are Network).</p>

  <p class="zh">广域网（WAN）连接起一个更大物理区域的计算机，例如城际间。还有些其它的类型，如城域网（MAN）、个人域网（PAN）甚至人体域网（BAN）。</p>

  <p class="en">An internet is a connection of two or more distinct networks, typically LANs or WANs. An intranet is an internet with all networks belonging to a single organisation.</p>

  <p class="zh">互联网是多个不同网络的连接，一般为LAN或WAN。内联网是属于某个组织的所有网络加上互联网。</p>

  <p class="en">There are significant differences between an internet and an intranet. Typically an intranet will be under a single administrative control, which will impose a single set of coherent policies. An internet on the other hand will not be under the control of a single body, and the controls exercised over different parts may not even be compatable.</p>

  <p class="zh">互联网与内联网之间有明显的不同。一般来说，一个内联网处在单一的管控之下，它将被应用一组统一的策略。另一方面，一个互联网则不会在单一主体的控制之下，控制的不同部分甚至可能会不兼容。</p>

  <p class="en">A trivial example of such differences is that an intranet will often be restricted to computers by a small number of vendors running a standardised version of a particular operating system. On the other hand, an internet will often have a smorgasborg of different computers and operating systems.</p>

  <p class="zh">这种不同的一个例子，就是一个内联网通常被少量供应商提供的，运行着特定操作系统标准化版本的计算机所限制。另一方面，一个互联网通常有各种各样的计算机和操作系统。</p>

  <p class="en">The techniques of this book will be applicable to internets. They will also be valid for intranets, but there you will also find specialised, non-portable systems.</p>

  <p class="zh">本书中的技术可应用于互联网。它们对内联网也是有效的，但你也会发现一些专有的，不可移植的系统。</p>

  <p class="en">And then there is the "mother" of all internets: The Internet. This is just a very, very large internet that connects us to Google, my computer to your computer and so on.</p>

  <p class="zh">所有互联网都有一个“母网”：因特网。它其实就是个非常巨大的互联网，它将我们与Google、我们的计算机等等互相连接起来。</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_10" class="en">Gateways</h2>

  <h2 id="heading_id_10" class="zh">网关</h2>

  <p class="en">A gateway is a generic term for an entity used to connect two or more networks. A repeater operates at the physical level copies the information from one subnet to another. A bridge operates at the data link layer level and copies frames between networks. A router operates at the network level and not only moves information between networks but also decides on the route.</p>

  <p class="zh">网关是一个统称，它用于连接起一个或多个网络。其中的中继器在物理层面上进行操作，它将信息从一个子网复制到另一个子网上。桥接在数据连接层面上进行操作，它在网络之间复制帧。路由器在网络层面上进行操作，它不仅在网络之间复制信息，还决定了信息的传输路线。</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_11" class="en">Packet encapsulation</h2>

  <h2 id="heading_id_11" class="zh">数据包封装</h2>

  <p>The communication between layers in either the OSI or the TCP/IP stacks is done by sending packets of data from one layer to the next, and then eventually across the network. Each layer has administrative information that it has to keep about its own layer. It does this by adding header information to the packet it receives from the layer above, as the packet passes down. On the receiving side, these headers are removed as the packet moves up.</p>

  <p>For example, the TFP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) moves files from one computer to another. It uses the UDP protocol on top of the IP protocol, which may be sent over Ethernet. This looks like:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/packets.gif" /><br />
  The packet transmitted over ethernet, is of course the bottom one.</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_12">Connection Models</h2>

  <p>In order for two computers to communicate, they must set up a path whereby they can send at least one message in a session. There are two major models for this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Connection oriented</li>

    <li>Connectionless</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="heading_id_13">Connection oriented</h3>

  <p>A single connection is established for the session. Two-way communications flow along the connection. When the session is over, the connection is broken. The analogy is to a phone conversation. An example is TCP</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_14">Connectionless</h3>

  <p>In a connectionless system, messages are sent independant of each other. Ordinary mail is the analogy. Connectionless messages may arrive out of order. An example is the IP protocol. Connection oriented transports may be established on top of connectionless ones - TCP over IP. Connectionless transports my be established on top of connection oriented ones - HTTP over TCP.</p>

  <p>There can be variations on these. For example, a session might enforce messages arriving, but might not guarantee that they arrive in the order sent. However, these two are the most common.</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_15">Communications Models</h2>

  <h3 id="heading_id_16">Message passing</h3>

  <p>Some non-procedural languages are built on the principle of <em>message passing</em>. Concurrent languages often use such a mechanism, and the most well known example is probably the Unix pipeline. The Unix pipeline is a pipeline of bytes, but there is not an inherent limitation: Microsoft's PowerShell can send objects along its pipelines, and concurrent languages such as Parlog could send arbitrary logic data structures in messages between concurrent processes.</p>

  <p>Message passing is a primitive mechanism for distributed systems. Set up a connection and pump some data down it. At the other end, figure out what the message was and respond to it, possibly sending messages back. This is illustrated by<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/msg.gif" /></p>

  <p>Low level event driven systems such as the X Window System function in a somewhat similar way: wait for message from a user (mouse clicks, etc), decode them and act on them.</p>

  <p>Higher level event driven systems assume that this decoding has been done by the underlying system and the event is then dispatched to an appropriate object such as a ButtonPress handler. This can also be done in distributed message passing systems, whereby a message received across the network is partly decoded and dispatched to an appropriate handler.</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_17">Remote procedure call</h3>

  <p>In any system, there is a transfer of information and flow control from one part of the system to another. In procedural languages this may consist of the procedure call, where information is placed on a call stack and then control flow is transferred to another part of the program.</p>

  <p>Even with procedure calls, there are variations. The code may be statically linked so that control transfers from one part of the program's executable code to another part. Due to the increasing use of library routines, it has become commonplace to have such code in dynamic link libraries (DLLs), where control transfers to an independent piece of code.</p>

  <p>DLLs run in the same machine as the calling code. it is a simple (conceptual) step to transfer control to a procedure running in a different machine. The mechanics of this are not so simple! However, this model of control has given rise to the "remote procedure call" (RPC) which is discussed in much detail in a later chapter. This is illustrated by<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/rpc.gif" /></p>

  <p>There is an historical oddity called the "lightweight remote procedure call" invented by Microsoft as they transitioned from 16-bit to 32-bit applications. A 16-bit application might need to transfer data to a 32-bit application <em>on the same machine</em>. That made it lightweight as there was no networking! But it had many of the other issues of RPC systems in data representations and conversion.</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_18">Distributed Computing Models</h2>

  <p>At the highest lvel, we could consider the equivalence or the non-equivalence of components of a distributed system. The most common occurrence is an asymmetric one: a client sends requests to a server, and the server responds. This is a <em>client-server</em> system.</p>

  <p>If both components are equivalent, both able to initiate and to respond to messages, then we have a <em>peer-to-peer</em> system. Note that this is a logical classification: one peer may be a 16,000 core mainframe, the other might be a mobile phone. But if both can act similarlym then they are peers.</p>

  <p>A third model is the so-called <em>filter</em>. Here one component passes information to another which modifies it before passing it to a third. This is a fairly common model: for example, the middle component gets information from a database as SQl records and transforms it into an HTML table for the third component (which might be a browser).</p>

  <p>These are illustrated as:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/peer.gif" /></p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_19">Client/Server System</h2>

  <p>Another view of a client server system is<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/cs-system.gif" /></p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_20">Client/Server Application</h2>

  <p>And a third view is<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/cs-application.gif" /></p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_21">Server Distribution</h2>

  <p>A client-server systems need not be simple. The basic model is single client, single server<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/one-one.gif" /><br />
  but you can also have multiple clients, single server<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/many-one.gif" /><br />
  In this, the master receives requests and instead of handling them one at a time itself, passes them off to other servers to handle. This is a common model when concurrent clients are possible.</p>

  <p>There are also single client, multiple servers<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/one-many.gif" /> which occurs frequently when a server needs to act as a client to other servers, such as a business logic server getting information from a database server. And of course, there could be multiple clients with multiple servers</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_22">Component Distribution</h2>

  <p>A simple but effective way of decomposing many applications is to consider them as made up of three parts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Presentation component</li>

    <li>Application logic</li>

    <li>Data access</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <em>presentation component</em> is responsible for interactions with the user, both displaying data and gathering input. it may be a modern GUI interface with buttons, lists, menus, etc, or an older command-line style interface, asking questions and getting answers. The details are not important at this level.</p>

  <p>The <em>application logic</em> is responsible for intrepreting the users' responses, for applying business rules, for preparing queries and managing responses from the thir component.</p>

  <p>The <em>data access</em> component is responsible for stroing and retrieving data. This will often be through a database, but not necessarily.</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_23">Gartner Classification</h3>

  <p>Based on this threefold decomposition of applicaitons, Gartner considered how the components might be distributed in a client-server sysem. They came up with five models:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/gartner.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_24">Example: Distributed Database</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Gartner classification: 1</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img alt="" src="../Images/gartner1.gif" /><br />
  Modern mobile phones make good examples of this: due to limited memory they may store a small part of a database locally so that they can usuall respond quickly. However, if data is required that is not held locally, then a request may be made to a remote database for that additional data.</p>

  <p>Google maps forms another good example. Al of the maps reside on Google's servers. When one is requested by a user, the "nearby" maps are also downloaded into a small database in the browser. When the user moves the map a little bit, the extra bits required are already in the local store for quick response.</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_25">Example: Network File Service</h3>

  <p>Gartner classification 2 allows remote clients acess to a shared file system<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/gartner2.gif" /><br />
  There are many examples of scuh systems: NFS, Microsoft shares, DCE, etc</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_26">Example: Web</h3>

  <p>An example of Gartner classification 3 is the Web with Java applets. This is a distributed hypertext system, with many additional mechanisms<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/gartner3.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_27">Example: Terminal Emulation</h3>

  <p>An example of Gartner classification 4 is terminal emulation. This allows a remote system to act as a normal terminal on a local system.<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/gartner4.gif" /><br />
  Telnet is the most common example of this.</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_28">Example: Expect</h3>

  <p>Expect is a novel illustration of Gartner classification 5. It acts as a wrapper around a classical system such as a command-line interface. It builds an X Window interface around this, so that the user interacts with a GUI, and the GUI in turn interacts with the command-line interface.<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/expect.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_29">Example: X Window System</h3>

  <p>The X Window System itself is an example of Gartner classification 5. An application makes GUI calls such as <code>DrawLine</code>, but these are not handled directly but instead passed to an X Window server for rendering. This decouples the application view of windowing and the display view of windowing.<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/gartner5.gif" /></p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_30">Three Tier Models</h3>

  <p>of course, if you have two tiers, then you can have three, four, or more. Some of the three tier possibilities are shown in this diagram:<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/threetier.gif" /></p>

  <p>The modern Web is a good example of the rightmost of these. The backend is made up of a database, often running stored procedures to hold some of the database logic. The middle tier is an HTTP server such as Apache running PHP scripts (or Ruby on Rails, or JSP pages, etc). This will manage some of the logic and will have data such as HTML pages stored locally. The frontend is a browser to display the pages, under the control of some Javascript. In HTML 5, the frontend may also have a local database.</p>

  <h3 id="heading_id_31">Fat vs thin</h3>

  <p>A common labelling of components is "fat" or "thin". Fat components take up lots of memory and do complex processing. Thin components on the other hand, do little of either. There don't seem to be any "normal" size components, only fat or thin!</p>

  <p>Fatness or thinness is a relative concept. Browsers are often laelled as thin because "all they do is diplay web pages". Firefox on my Linux box takes nearly 1/2 a gigabyte of memory, which I don't regard as small at all!</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_32">Middleware model</h2>

  <p>Middleware is teh "glue" connecting components of a distributed system. The middleware model is<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/middleware.gif" /></p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_33">Middleware</h2>

  <p>Components of middleware include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The network services include things like TCP/IP</li>

    <li>The middleware layer is application-independent s/w using the network services</li>

    <li>Examples of middleware are: DCE, RPC, Corba</li>

    <li>Middleware may only perform one function (such as RPC) or many (such as DCE)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="heading_id_34">Middleware examples</h3>

  <p>Examples of middleware include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Primitive services such as terminal emulators, file transfer, email</li>

    <li>Basic services such as RPC</li>

    <li>Integrated services such as DCE, Network O/S</li>

    <li>Distributed object services such as CORBA, OLE/ActiveX</li>

    <li>Mobile object services such as RMI, Jini</li>

    <li>World Wide Web</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="heading_id_35">Middleware functions</h3>

  <p>The functions of middleware include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Initiation of processes at different computers</li>

    <li>Session management</li>

    <li>Directory services to allow clients to locate servers</li>

    <li>remote data access</li>

    <li>Concurrency control to allow servers to handle multiple clients</li>

    <li>Security and integrity</li>

    <li>Monitoring</li>

    <li>Termination of processes both local and remote</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="heading_id_36">Continuum of Processing</h2>

  <p>The Gartner model is based on a breakdown of an application into the components of presentation, application logic and data handling. A finer grained breakdown is<br />
  <img alt="" src="../Images/continuum.gif" /></p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_37">Points of Failure</h2>

  <p>Distributed applications run in a complex environment. This makes them much more prone to failure than standalone applications on a single computer. The points of failure include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The client side of the application could crash</li>

    <li>The client system may have h/w problems</li>

    <li>The client's network card could fail</li>

    <li>Network contention could cause timeouts</li>

    <li>There may be network address conflicts</li>

    <li>Network elements such as routers could fail</li>

    <li>Transmission errors may lose messages</li>

    <li>The client and server versions may be incompatable</li>

    <li>The server's network card could fail</li>

    <li>The server system may have h/w problems</li>

    <li>The server s/w may crash</li>

    <li>The server's database may become corrupted</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Applications have to be designed with these possible failures in mind. Any action performed by one component must be recoverable if failure occurs in some other part of the system. Techniques such as transactions and continuous error checking need to be employed to avoid errors.</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_38">Acceptance Factors</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reliability</li>

    <li>Performance</li>

    <li>Responsiveness</li>

    <li>Scalability</li>

    <li>Capacity</li>

    <li>Security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="heading_id_39">Transparency</h2>

  <p>The "holy grails" of distributed systems are to provide the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>access transparency</li>

    <li>location transparency</li>

    <li>migration transparency</li>

    <li>replication transparency</li>

    <li>concurrency transparency</li>

    <li>scalability transparency</li>

    <li>performance transparency</li>

    <li>failure transparency</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="heading_id_40">Eight fallacies of distributed computing</h2>

  <p>Sun Microsystems was a company that performed much of the early work in distributed systems, and even had a mantra "The network is the computer." Based on their experience over many years a number of the scientists at Sun came up with the following list of fallacies commonly assumed:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The network is reliable.</li>

    <li>Latency is zero.</li>

    <li>Bandwidth is infinite.</li>

    <li>The network is secure.</li>

    <li>Topology doesn't change.</li>

    <li>There is one administrator.</li>

    <li>Transport cost is zero.</li>

    <li>The network is homogeneous.</li>

  <p>Many of these directly impact on network programming. For example, the design of most remote procedure call systems is based on the premise that the network is reliable so that a remote procedure call will behave in the same way as a local call. The fallacies of zero latency and infinite bandwidth also lead to assumptions about the time duration of an RPC call being the same as a local call, whereas they are magnitudes of order slower.</p>

  <p>The recognition of these fallacies led Java's RMI (remote method invocation) model to require every RPC call to potentially throw a <code>RemoteException</code>. This forced programmers to at least recognise the possibility of network error and to remind them that they could not expect the same speeds as local calls.</p>
